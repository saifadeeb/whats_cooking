# What's Cooking

This project is my take on the What's Cooking Kaggle competition. The goal of the competition was to predict the cuisine type based on a set of ingredients. Using NLP (specifically TF-IDF vectorizers), I created features from the list of ingredients and trained many machine learning models to learn the relationships between ingredients and cuisine types. Then I evaluate the performance of each of these machine learning models and see which was the best at accurately predicting the cuisine type of a recipe.
